# The Impact of School-Based Physical Education Programs on Adolescent Self-Control and Mental Health

This repository contains code and research materials related to the study "The Impact of School-Based Physical Education Programs on Adolescent Self-Control and Mental Health." The study explores the role of school-based physical education (PE) programs in improving adolescent self-control and mental health. It proposes an innovative approach that combines the Personalized Activity Optimization Model (PAOM) and the Dynamic Program Optimization Strategy (DPOS) to tailor PE programs for maximizing both physical and mental health outcomes for adolescents.

## Abstract

Adolescence is a critical period for developing self-control and mental health, with school-based physical education (PE) programs playing a pivotal role in shaping these outcomes. Traditional PE programs often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, overlooking the unique and dynamic nature of adolescent behavior, mental well-being, and social contexts. This study introduces a novel and integrative framework combining the Personalized Activity Optimization Model (PAOM) with the Dynamic Program Optimization Strategy (DPOS) to assess and enhance the impact of PE programs on self-control and mental health.

PAOM personalizes activity recommendations by integrating participant attributes, such as baseline fitness levels, psychological traits, and preferences, with real-time feedback on physical and mental health metrics. DPOS dynamically optimizes activity schedules, incorporating contextual factors such as peer interactions, resource availability, environmental conditions, and group dynamics to maximize program outcomes.

Experimental results from a longitudinal study demonstrate significant improvements in self-control, emotional regulation, and reductions in stress levels among adolescents, highlighting the effectiveness of this personalized and adaptive approach. These findings emphasize the potential of leveraging advanced modeling techniques and real-time data to design impactful PE programs that not only promote physical health but also support the broader developmental and mental health needs of adolescents.
